# Simulation Methods and Stochastic Algorithms

This is the main repository for the CDT course of simulation methods and stochastic algorithms offered at University and Oxford. 

## Content
- Warm up task (taken from 2021 edition Q1)
- [Question 1](https://github.com/Samuel-CHLam/Oxford_Simulation_Methods_and_Stochastic_Algorithms/blob/main/Question_1.ipynb) (taken from 2021 edition Q2)
- Question 2 (taken from 2021 edition Q3)
- Question 3
- Question 4

## Contribution

Although officially students should be divided into groups of 3-4 for the course, everyone's contribution is welcomed and appreciated! You can help as a 

- primary coder: you will be responsible for actually doing the coding tasks.
- second coder: you will work alongside with your primary coder to help proofread the code, read the documentations, possibly refactor the codes for submissions and creating figures.
- analyst: you will be performing analysis on the numerical experiments and finish the write-ups.

## Resources available
Please first consult the [official website materials](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=755) and the [archived version](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=287). In addition, you may refer to the following materials:

- Undergraduate course on [Computational Stochastic Processes](https://urbain.vaes.uk/teaching/2020-csp/), offered in Spring 2020 by Dr. Urbain Vaes at Imperial College London.
- Undergraduate course on elementary Stochastic Simulation, offered in Fall 2021 by Prof. Emma McCoy at Imperial College London. Materials are only provided through the [Imperial College MathWiki](https://imperialmathswiki.com/3rd_4th_pg_years/statistics/Stochastic_Simulation) (IC MathWiki), for which only members having an Imperial College account can access. We will try to negotiate for access from Oxford members.
- One of my collaborator (from IC MathWiki), [Thomas Walker](https://github.com/ThomasWalker1), has done a really nice project of investigating various methods of generating uniform random variables. The repository is [here](https://github.com/ThomasWalker1/PRNGs).

## IC MathWiki openings
- We need contributors to the following courses offered at Imperial:
    - Elementary Stochastic Simulation: need contributions on numerical demonstrations and review on pages.
    - Computational Stochastic Processes: need contributions on writing the summaries for the course.
    - Subject to the lecturer approval, we may put this CDT course live in IC MathWiki!

Anyone interested in contributing should contact me (chun.lam@univ.ox.ac.uk) or Thomas Walker (thomas.walker21@imperial.ac.uk).
